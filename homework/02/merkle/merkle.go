	   ### Pseudo Code

	   1. Create a slice to hold the hashes of the leaves.  Each leaf hash is a `[]byte`.  So make the data type `[][]byte`.
	   	Make this slice of slice of byte then length of the data.  That would be `len(data)`.  Let's call this `hTmp`.
	   2. For each data block
	   	1. Calculate a hash for the data block using `hash.HashOf()`.
	   	2. Save this in the slice created in (1) above.
	   3. Create a `[][]byte` slice to hold the intermediate hashes in the tree.
	   	This will need to be no more than `len(data)/2+1` in length.  The plus 1 is so that 0 blocks of hasing or an odd
	   	number of blocks will have enough space.  Let's call this `hMid`.
	   4. Declare a variable `ln`, and set it to  `len(data)/2+1`
	   5. While `ln >= 1` (Hint: the language only has `for` loops with lots of different ways of doing it)
	   	1. For each pair of hashes (if you have an odd number just use the single hash)
	   		- Calculate the hash of the pair using `hash.Keccak256()`.  It takes a variable number of arguments so you can
	   		  pass 1 or 2 arguments to it.
	   		- Append this to `hMid`.
	   	2. Replace hTmp with hMid
	   	3. Recalculate `ln` set it to `len(hTmp)/2`
	   	4. Generate a new empty hMid of allocated space of `len(hTmp)/2`.
	   6. Return `hTmp[0]`
