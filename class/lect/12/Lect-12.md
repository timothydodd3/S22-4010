# Lecture 12 - Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures

## Feb 14 2022

Every transaction has to be digitally signed to verify that the author
of the transaction (the spender) is valid.   Both Bitcoin and Ethereum
use EC cryptography to do this.  Specifically the ECDSA or Elliptic Curve
Digital Signature Algorithm to do this.



## Signatures and Validation

So... there are a bunch of uses of EC but the use that we want is to **sign** content to prove that the person holding the private key `N` is who they claim to be.
In Bitcoin and Ethereum (and our homework) we are using this to verify transactions - this keeps other people from opening the UTxO's that belong to you.

In our examples `p` the (Order(n)) size of our examples is 19.  It has to be relatively prime and is a prime number in this case.

Our starting point, `P` is `(11,7)`.  In the real Ed25519 signature system (Based on Curve25519) the modulo value is the `2**255-19` and the base point is

x=15112221349535400772501151409588531511454012693041857206046113283949847762202

y=46316835694926478169428394003475163141307993866256225615783033603165251855960

So big numbers...

Curve25519 also defines the values that give us the exact curve (the 'a' and 'b' values).

### Signing Algorithm

Input is our public and private keys.   You have to have the private key to sign, you have to have the
public key to verify.  The agreement on curve, starting point and order need to be in place to start
the this.

Output is a pair `{r,s}` that act as a verifiable signature.  In our special case this is actually `{r,s,v}`
where v is a 0, 1 (we will get back to `v` in a moment)



1. take the message and calculate the hash of the message.  This is a 32 byte Sha256 or Keccak hash of the message.
`h = hash(msg)`.
2. Generate securely a random number `k` in the range `[1..n-1]`.  The value must be from 1 to `2**256` in our case.  So a 32 byte random value.
3. Calculate the random point `R = k * P` and take its x-coordinate: `r = R.x`
4. Calculate the signature proof: <img style="inline:block;" src="proof1.png">
6. Return the `signature {r, s}`.


## Verification Algorithm

The algorithm to verify a ECDSA signature takes as input the signed message msg + the signature {r, s} produced from the signing algorithm + the public key pubKey, corresponding to the signer's private key. The output is boolean value: valid or invalid signature. The ECDSA signature verify algorithm works as follows (with minor simplifications):

1. Calculate the message hash, with the same cryptographic hash function used during the signing: `h = hash(msg)`.   This can also be achieved by passing both the message, the hash and then re-hashing the message and comparing the generated hash with the passed hash.   We will do it this way.
2. Calculate the modular inverse of the signature proof: <img style="inline:block;" src="s1.png">
3. Recover the random point used during the signing: `R' = (h * s1) * G + (r * s1) * pubKey`
4. Take from `R'` its x-coordinate: `r' = R'.x`
5. Calculate the signature validation result by comparing whether `r' == r`

The idea behind signature verification is to recover the point `R'` using the public key and check whether it is same point `R`, generated randomly when the message was signed.

This scheme allows for the recovery of the public key from the signature and the message.  This means that a receiver of a signed message will not need to keep a huge table
of all public keys around.  The disadvantage is that you have to check the recovered key is the correct public key for the account.  In our system (and Ethereum) are accounts
are the first 24 bytes of the 32 byte public key.  So when we recover the public key we chop it to 24 bytes and compare it to the account number.

Also when we recover a public key we can get 4 different answers.  This is what the `v` value is used for.
