// MineBlock implements a proof of work mining system where the first 4 digits (2 bytes) of the hex value are
// 0000.  Difficulty can be increaesed by requiring more digits to be 0 or by requring some other pattern to
// apear in the resulting hash.

	// Pseudo-Code
	//
	// 1. Use an infinite loop to:
	//    1. Searilize the data from the block for hasing, Call block.SerializeForSeal to do this.
	//    2. Calculate the hash of the data, Call hash.HashOf to do this. This is the slow part.  What would
	//      happen if we replaced the software with a hash calculator on a graphics card where you could run
	//      4096 hahes at once?  What would happen if we replaced the graphics card with an ASIC - so you had
	//      dedicated hardware to do the hash and you could run 4 billion hashes a second?
	//    3. Convert the hash (it is []byte) to a hex string.  Use the hex.EncodeToString standard go library
	//      function.
	//    4. `fmt.Printf("((Mining)) Hash for Block [%s] nonce [%8d]\r", theHashAsAString, bk.Nonce)`
	//        `\r` will overwrite the same line instead of advancing to the next.
	//    5. See if the first 4 characters of the hash are 0's. - if so we have met the work criteria.
	//        In go this is `if theHashAsAString[0:4] == "0000" {`.  This is create a slice, 4 long from
	//        character 0 with length of 4, then compare that to the string `"0000"`.
	//        - Set the blcoks "Seal" to the hash
	//        - `fmt.Printf("((Mining)) Hash for Block [%s] nonce [%8d]\n", theHashAsAString, bk.Nonce)`
	//          `\n` will overwrite the same *and then advance* to the next line.
	//        - return
	//    5. Increment the Nonce in the block, and...
	//    6. Back to the top of the loop for another try at finding a seal for this block.
	//
	// For the genesis block, when I do this it requires 54586 trips through the loop to calculate the
	// proof of work.
